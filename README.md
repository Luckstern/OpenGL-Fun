# 2D-OpenGL-Game
This is my first dive into working with pure OpenGL in C++. I've done a bit of programming with C++ in the past, but this is my first time doing a proper project with it. I've also always wanted to make a game using OpenGL after watching people do it on YouTube.

### Learning OpenGL
Learning OpenGL definitely took quite a while to learn since it's quite barebones and doesn't have many of the QOL features that many graphics libraries have. In my case, it took 10s of lines just to create a window and then many more just to draw a simple, solid color rectangle in that window. None of this would've been possible if it weren't for [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/). The guides were easy to follow and explained a ton of the confusing code being written.

### The Project
After I had the basics down like shaders and processing input, I had to decide what I wanted my game to do. I eventually landed ..
